The Image Interface code consists of the following files:

cppCasaImageInterface.cpp
	This is the main interface that contains functions for:
		i.reading from a 256-level grayscale bitmap file
		ii. writing to a 256-level grayscale bitmap file
		iii. writing to a CASA image

cppTestCasaImageInterface.cpp
	This is an example program which shows how to use the interface. It will load an image of the Lovell telescope from the supplied bitmap file and write it to a CASA image

lovell.bmp
	An example image for testing

makefile
	An example of how to compile the code. We compile the interface and the program that calls the interface.
	The first line of the makefile is the pathname of the casacore folder, and should be updated before attempting to compile.


System requirements:

Casacore MUST be installed for the interface to work.
