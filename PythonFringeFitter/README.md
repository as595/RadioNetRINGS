# Dispersive delay prototype

This repository contains the fringe fitter python prototype within which to implement an algorithm for dispersive delay correction. It was cloned from [BHC Pipeline Calibration](https://bitbucket.org/drrossum/bhc-pipeline-calibration), which was a Mercurial repo. In an attempt to preserve the previous commit history, it was converted it to Git following [this tutorial](http://learnaholic.me/2013/02/01/converting-mercurial-hg-to-git-repository-on-mac/) and pushed to GitHub. Note that the original code ([this commit](https://github.com/rainsworth/RadioNetRINGS/commit/ffcac46ce7ddc390ac57a77c84e924fd10cf2d2c)) authors are:
* Des Small
